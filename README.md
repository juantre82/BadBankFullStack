# BadBankCapStone

## Description
This project was made to showcase everything I have learned while attending MIT xPro and to encapslate the learnings into one project. 
This is a three tier application of a bank with very little security, although it does have a frontend that was built using JS, CSS, HTML, and React.JS.
The Backend is compose with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase.
